## Approach

创建字典保存每次取余后数值出现的频率，在更新字典value前，先更新counts(相当于+ 1 * 已有的配对键值)

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

古早做法（分情况计数）：

```python
class Solution:
    def numPairsDivisibleBy60(self, time):
        k = 60
        n = len(time)
        freq = [0] * k
        for each in time:
            freq[each % 60] += 1
        
        # count item which 60 is factor of it
        counts = freq[0] * (freq[0] - 1) // 2
        # count item which has residue 30 when divided by 60
        counts += freq[30] * (freq[30] - 1) // 2
        # count others
        for i in range(1, 30):
            counts += freq[i] * freq[k - i]
        
        return counts
```

现在做法：

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def numPairsDivisibleBy60(self, time: List[int]) -> int:
        dic = defaultdict(int)
        counts = 0
        for t in time:
            if t % 60 == 0:
                counts += dic[0]
            else:
                counts += dic[60 - t % 60]
            dic[t % 60] += 1
        return counts
```
