## Approach

- **Time Complexity: O(N)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicateLetters(self, s: str) -> str:
        maxIdxStore = {c:i for i,c in enumerate(s)}
        stack = []
        seen = set()
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c not in seen:
                while stack and stack[-1] > c and maxIdxStore[stack[-1]] > i:
                    # remember we also need to delete c from seen which costs O(1) tpp
                    seen.discard(stack.pop())
                stack.append(c)
                seen.add(c)
        return ''.join(stack)
```

we also has recursion version which is slow.
