## Approach

TLE:

```python
class WordDictionary:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.mySet = set()
        self.length = 0

    def addWord(self, word: str) -> None:
        self.mySet.add(word)
        self.length = max(self.length, len(word))

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        if len(word) > self.length:
            return False
        if '.' not in word:
            return word in self.mySet
        tmp = []
        isIn = True
        for idx, char in enumerate(word):
            if char != '.':
                tmp.append(idx)
        for each in self.mySet:
            isIn = True
            if len(each) != len(word):
                isIn = False
                continue
            for idx in tmp:
                if each[idx] != word[idx]:
                    isIn = False
                    break
            if isIn == True:
                break
        return isIn


# Your WordDictionary object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = WordDictionary()
# obj.addWord(word)
# param_2 = obj.search(word)
```

## Approach 2 : HashTable

- **Time Complexity: O(LN)**

where L is a length of the word to find, and N is the number of words.

- **Space Complexity: O(Nlen(N))**

```python
class WordDictionary:

    def __init__(self):
        self.mySet = defaultdict(set)

    def addWord(self, word: str) -> None:
        self.mySet[len(word)].add(word)

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        m = len(word)
        if not self.mySet[m]:
            return False
        for words in self.mySet[m]:
            i = 0
            while i < m and (words[i] == word[i] or '.' == word[i]):
                i += 1
            if i == m:
                return True
        return False
```

## Approach 3 : Trie

- ADD

> **Time Complexity: O(L)** where L is a length of the word to add

> **Space Complexity: O(Nlen(N))** to insert new

- SEARCH

> **Time Complexity:** O(L) for no dot, O(L^26) fro dot in word(worst case) where L is a length of the word to search

> **Space Complexity:** O(1) for no dot, O(N) for word has dot to keep the recursion stack.

```python
class WordDictionary:

    def __init__(self):
        self.myTrie = dict()

    def addWord(self, word: str) -> None:
        node = self.myTrie
        for char in word:
            if char not in node:
                node[char] = dict()
            node = node[char]
        # $ is the end-of-word marker
        # for the case addWord("dogs") -> search("dog") to return False
        node['$'] = True

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        def searchInNode(word, node) -> bool:
            for idx, char in enumerate(word):
                # if the character in this level, go down to the next level in trie
                if char in node:
                    node = node[char]
                # if the current character is '.', check all possible nodes at this level
                else:
                    if char == '.':
                        for each in node:
                            if each != '$' and searchInNode(word[idx+1:], node[each]):
                                return True
                    return False
            return '$' in node
        
        return searchInNode(word, self.myTrie)
```

## Conclusion

### 1. Tire Intro

Tire is a prefix tree which is a kind of search ordered tree data structure mostly used for the efficient dynamic add/search operations with the strings.

There are two main types of trie interview questions:

- Standard Trie: 211, 212, 642, 208

- Bitwise Trie: 421

### 2. Why Tire Not HashMap

it's not efficient for the most important practical use cases:

- Finding all keys with a common prefix.

- Enumerating a dataset of strings in lexicographical order.

- Scaling for the large datasets.

### 3. Trie Time Complexity

It's said in solution it's O(N * 26^M) which I don't understand, I think O(26^M) is enough.
