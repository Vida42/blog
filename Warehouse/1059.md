## Approach

- **Time Complexity: O(V+E)**

- **Space Complexity: O(V+E)**

```python
class Solution:
    def leadsToDestination(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], source: int, destination: int) -> bool:
        self.graph, self.seen = collections.defaultdict(set), set()
        for a, b in edges:
            self.graph[a].add(b)
        return self.dfs(source, destination)

    def dfs(self, i, destination):
        self.seen.add(i)
        for j in self.graph[i]:
            if j == i or j in self.seen or not self.dfs(j, destination):
                return False
        self.seen.discard(i)
        # this line can't be deleted
        # or it will stores destination in seen and return false if have two paths
        return len(self.graph[i]) != 0 or i == destination
