## Approach

- **Time Complexity: O(2^N)**

for every bracket we will have two options i.e. whether to remove it or consider it. 

- **Space Complexity: O(N)**

because we are resorting to a recursive solution and for a recursive solution there is always stack space used as internal function states are saved onto a stack during recursion.

The maximum depth of recursion decides the stack space used. Since we process one character at a time and the base case for the recursion is when we have processed all of the characters of the expression string, the size of the stack would be O(N).

```python
class Solution(object):

    def removeInvalidParentheses(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        self.valid_expressions = set()
        self.min_removed = float("inf")

        # Recursive call
        self.remaining(s, 0, 0, 0, [], 0)
        return list(self.valid_expressions)

    def remaining(self, string, index, left_count, right_count, expr, rem_count):
        """
            string: The original string we are recursing on.
            index: current index in the original string.
            left: number of left parentheses till now.
            right: number of right parentheses till now.
            ans: the resulting expression in this particular recursion.
            ignored: number of parentheses ignored in this particular recursion.
        """
        # If we have reached the end of string
        if index == len(string):
            # If the current expression is valid.
            if left_count == right_count:
                if rem_count < self.min_removed:
                    # If the current count of brackets removed < current minimum,
                    # ignore previous answers and update the current minimum count.
                    self.valid_expressions = set()
                    self.valid_expressions.add("".join(expr)) 
                    self.min_removed = rem_count
                elif rem_count == self.min_removed:
                    self.valid_expressions.add("".join(expr))
        else:
            current_char = string[index]

            if current_char != '(' and  current_char != ')':
                self.remaining(string, index + 1, left_count, right_count, expr+[current_char], rem_count)
            else:
                # Else, one recursion is with ignoring(remove) the current character.
                # So, we increment the ignored counter and leave the left and right untouched.
                self.remaining(string, index + 1, left_count, right_count, expr, rem_count + 1)
                # If the current parenthesis is an opening bracket, we consider it
                # and increment left and  move forward
                if string[index] == '(':
                    self.remaining(string, index + 1, left_count + 1, right_count, expr+[current_char], rem_count)
                elif right_count < left_count:
                    # If the current parenthesis is a closing bracket, we consider it only if we
                    # have more number of opening brackets and increment right and move forward.
                    self.remaining(string, index + 1, left_count, right_count + 1, expr+[current_char], rem_count)
