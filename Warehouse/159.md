## Approach

we can use template in [76](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/discuss/26808/Here-is-a-10-line-template-that-can-solve-most-'substring'-problems).

1. order of map manipulation is different
2. put update res outside of loop
3. way to update res(**right-left**) is kinda tricky
4. or can use `max` function to update res

- **Time Complexity: O(N)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

there are only at most 3 elements in dict

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s:
            return 0
        lookup = defaultdict(int)
        left, right = 0, 0
        required = 0
        res = (float('-inf'), 0, 0)
        
        while right < len(s):
            char = s[right]
            if lookup[char] == 0:
                required += 1
            lookup[char] += 1
            right += 1
            while left <= right and required > 2:
                char = s[left]
                # the following seq is diff from 79(Minimum Window Substring)
                if lookup[char] == 1:
                    required -= 1
                lookup[char] -= 1
                left += 1
            # update maximum after the inner while loop to guarantee that the substring is valid
            if right - left > res[0]:
                res = (right - left, left, right)
        return res[0]
