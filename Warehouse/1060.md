## Approach

- **Time Complexity: O(N)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def missingElement(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return nums[0] + k
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            diff = nums[i]-nums[i-1]-1
            if diff >= k:
                return nums[i-1] + k
            k -= diff
        return nums[-1] + k
```

## Approach : Binary Search

First solution scan from left to right, we can also use cumulative diff.

say [4, 7, 9, 10] has diff: 2, 1, 0 (in 1st sol)

we can also say it has cumulative diff: 2, 3, 3

so the cumulative diff would also be ascending, then answer is to find k

- **Time Complexity: O(logN)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def missingElement(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        if k > nums[-1]-nums[0]-n+1:
            return k + nums[0] + n -1
        left, right = 0, n-1
        while left+1 < right:
            mid = left + (right-left)//2
            if nums[mid]-nums[0]-mid < k:
                left = mid
            elif nums[mid]-nums[0]-mid > k:
                right = mid
            else:
                return nums[mid]-1
        return k + nums[0] + left
```

using lambda

```python
class Solution:
    def missingElement(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        missing = lambda i: nums[i]-nums[0]-i
        n = len(nums)
        if k > missing(n-1):
            return nums[n-1] + k - missing(n-1)
        left, right = 0, n-1
        while left+1 < right:
            mid = left + (right-left)//2
            if missing(mid) < k:
                left = mid
            elif missing(mid) > k:
                right = mid
            else:
                return nums[mid]-1
        return nums[left] + k - missing(left)
```

## Conclusion

1. we can use `missing = lambda idx: nums[idx]-nums[0]-idx`, then `missing(i)` instead of `missing = nums[i]-nums[0]-i`

2. why left + 1 < right?

> While "l < h" could also finish the job, but in this case the l + 1 < h will be helpful. Because in this way the l and r will be the neighbors when they stop. So we could directly do nums[l] + k instead of moving the l back the previous valid position. Eg. [4,7,9,10] when stopping search l = 0, r = 1

my explain:

```
left, x, right
so left + 1 < right
and x is mid
if missing(mid) < k:
    x becomes new left, left and right is neighbor now(loop stops), we return just like nums[left] is the rightmost element
if missing(mid) == k:
    ok just return element left adjancent to x
if missing(mid) > k:
    x becomes new right, res should between (left, x), left&right become neighbor(loop stop), same situation as situation 1.
