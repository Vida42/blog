## Approach

- **Time Complexity: O(MN)**

M is length of equations, N is length of queries

- **Space Complexity: O(M)**

```python
class Solution:
    def calcEquation(self, equations: List[List[str]], values: List[float], queries: List[List[str]]) -> List[float]:
        graph = self.buildGraph(equations, values)
        results = []
        for dividend, divisor in queries:
            if dividend not in graph or divisor not in graph:
                res = -1.0
            elif dividend == divisor:
                res = 1.0
            else:
                res = self.dfs(dividend, divisor, graph, 1, set())
            results.append(res)
        return results

    def buildGraph(self, equations, values):
        # build directed weighted graph
        graph = defaultdict(defaultdict)
        n = len(equations)
        for i in range(n):
            dividend, divisor, value = equations[i][0], equations[i][1], values[i]
            graph[dividend][divisor] = value
            graph[divisor][dividend] = 1/value
        return graph

    def dfs(self, start, end, graph, product, visited):
        visited.add(start)
        res = -1.0
        neighbors = graph[start]
        if end in neighbors:
            res = product * neighbors[end]
        else:
            for neigh, val in neighbors.items():
                if neigh in visited:
                    continue
                res = self.dfs(neigh, end, graph, product*val, visited)
                if res != -1.0:
                    break
        visited.discard(start)
        return res
