# 84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-%23d9534f)

> Description
> 
> Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

## Approach 1 : Brute Force

Considering every possible pair of bars and finding the area of the rectangle formed between them.

- **Time Complexity: O(n^2)**


- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        maxArea = 0
        length = len(heights)
        for i in range(length):
            minH = float('inf')
            for j in range(i, length):
                minH = min(minH, heights[j])
                maxArea = max(maxArea, minH * (j-i+1))
        return maxArea
```

## Approach 2 : Stack


- **Time Complexity: O(n)**


- **Space Complexity: O(n)**

```python

```

It's not 42...
