# 1197. Minimum Knight Moves

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-%23f0ad4e)

> Description
> 
> In an infinite chess board, you have a knight at square [0, 0]. A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.
> 
> Return the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square [x, y]. It is guaranteed the answer exists.


## Approach

BFS

- **Time Complexity: O(xy)**

- **Space Complexity: O(xy)**，每个点queue里放一遍



```python
class Solution:
    def minKnightMoves(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        # BFS
        if x == 0 and y == 0:
            return 0
        directions = [(1, 2), (-1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, -2), (2, 1), (-2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, -1)]
        queue = collections.deque([(0, 0, 0)])
        visited = set([(0,0)])
        x, y = abs(x), abs(y)
        # as knight moves are symmetric and we are only required to get stpes
        # we donot need to BFS in all four quadrants
        # moves to reach (-2,100) and (2, 100) and (-2,-100) and (2,-100) are all same
        # so we are moving only in first quadrant
        while queue:
            i, j, d = queue.popleft()
            for di, dj in directions:
                nbr = (i + di, j + dj)
                if nbr not in visited and nbr[0] >= -2 and nbr[1] >= -2:
                    if nbr[0] == x and nbr[1] == y:
                        return d + 1
                    queue.append((nbr[0], nbr[1], d + 1))
                    visited.add(nbr)
```

## Conclusion

1. 四个方向取一个方向即可因只需找步数
2. 判断下一步move是否valid的条件不是象限边界，因为一些挪出去一步再挪回来也是valid的(比如两步到(1,1))
