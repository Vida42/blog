# 763. Partition Labels

> awful desciprtion, see example:

```
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
```

> "I also wouldn't mind if the problem was worded better. When even youtube commentators on the code say the problem wording is confusing you know you messed up."

## Approach: Greedy

> Hint:
>
> Try to greedily choose the smallest partition that includes the first letter. If you have something like "abaccbdeffed", then you might need to add b. You can use an map like "last['b'] = 5" to help you expand the width of your partition.

```python
class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, S: str) -> List[int]:
        last = dict()
        for i, c in enumerate(S):
            last[c] = i
        mark = 0
        start = 0
        res = []

        for i, c in enumerate(S):
            mark = max(mark, last[c])
            if i == mark:
                res.append(i - start + 1)
                start = i + 1
        return res
```
