# 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-%235cb85c)

> Description
> 
> Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

## Approach

DONE BY SELF TOO EASY


- **Time Complexity: O(n)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**


```python
class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        tmp, res = 0, []
        for i in nums:
            tmp += i
            res.append(tmp)
        return res
```

## Conclusion

NO NEED TO DO IT AGAIN
