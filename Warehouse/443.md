## Approach

Read and Write

- **Time Complexity: O(N)**


- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        length = len(chars)
        if length < 2:
            return length

        # anchor to mark 1st location of current consecutive
        # write to mark next loc of anchor
        anchor, write = 0, 0
        for pos, char in enumerate(chars):
            if (pos + 1) == length or char != chars[pos+1]:
                chars[write] = char
                write += 1

                # if appears more than once
                if pos > anchor:
                    repeatTimes = pos - anchor + 1
                    # write the number
                    for num in str(repeatTimes):
                        chars[write] = num
                        write += 1

                        # move the anchor to the next char in the iteration
                anchor = pos + 1

        return write
```

## Note

write a straight and complex one on 6/7.

```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        if not chars:
            return 0
        mark = 0
        char = chars[0]
        count = 1
        for i in range(1, len(chars)):
            if chars[i] == chars[i-1]:
                count += 1
            else:
                if count == 1:
                    chars[mark] = char
                    mark += 1
                else:
                    chars[mark:mark+len(str(count))+1] = char+str(count)
                    mark = mark+len(str(count))+1
                char = chars[i]
                count = 1

        if count == 1:
            chars[mark] = char
            mark += 1
        else:
            chars[mark:mark+len(str(count))+1] = char+str(count)
            mark = mark+len(str(count))+1

        return mark
```
