# 453. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-%235cb85c)

> Description
> 
> Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.

## Approach 1 : BRUTE FORCE, TLE

each time we add 1 to each element except maximum one, until the maximum and the minimum are equal

- **Time Complexity: O(kn)**

k is the difference between min and max, n is the length of list

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        maximum = max(nums)
        minimum = min(nums)
        move = 0
        while minimum != maximum:
            nums[nums.index(maximum)] -= 1
            nums = [i + 1 for i in nums]
            maximum = max(nums)
            minimum = min(nums)
            move += 1
        return move
```

## Approach 2 : MATH

This approach is based on the idea that adding 1 to all the elements except one is equivalent to decrementing 1 from a single element. Thus, the problem is simplified to find the number of decrement operations required to equalize all the elements of the given array. For finding this, it is obvious that we'll reduce all the elements of the array to the minimum element.

The moves(number of deduction) we need to make is:

(i - min) for i from 1 to n, i.e. sum(nums) - min * len(sums)

> Another Explanation:
â€‹   
Suppose there're k elements, the sum of original array is s, the minimum move is m, eventually all the elements become e, we know each move contributes (k-1) to the sum, so we have: `s + (k-1) * m = k * e`

for the minimum element min, it must be added m times, i.e. `min + m = e`

The two equations above would give us `m = s - k * min`


- **Time Complexity: O(n)**

One pass for finding minimum and one pass for calculating moves.

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**


```python
class Solution:
    def minMoves(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return sum(nums) - len(nums) * min(nums)
```
