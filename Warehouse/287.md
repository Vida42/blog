## Approach : Sort

- **Time Complexity: O(NlogN)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            if nums[i+1] == nums[i]:
                return nums[i]
```

## Approach : Set

- **Time Complexity: O(N)**

- **Space Complexity: O(N)**

```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        seen = set()
        for i in nums:
            if i in seen:
                return i
            seen.add(i)
```

## Approach : Floyd's Tortoise and Hare

> Can you solve the problem without modifying the array nums?

> Can you solve the problem using only constant, O(1) extra space?

> Can you solve the problem with runtime complexity less than O(n2)?

Same as [142](https://github.com/Vida42/Leetcode/blob/master/Warehouse/142._Linked_List_Cycle_II.md)

In [Appraoch 3](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/solution/) we can find there exists a circle using nums[0], nums[nums[0]], nums[nums[nums]0]... sequence, then using slow-fast pointers as in 142 to get the solution.

- **Time Complexity: O(N)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        hare, turtle = nums[0], nums[0]
        while hare and nums[hare]:
            hare = nums[nums[hare]]
            turtle = nums[turtle]
            if hare == turtle:
                break

        turtle2 = nums[0]
        while turtle2 != turtle:
            turtle = nums[turtle]
            turtle2 = nums[turtle2]
        return turtle
```

## Approach : Binary Search

Here is one binary search version but complexity would be O(nlogn)

```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(nums)-1
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right-left)//2
            counts = 0
            for i in nums:
                if i <= mid:
                    counts += 1
            if counts > mid:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left

```

## Conclusion

Problem redirection is pretty good.
