# 797. All Paths From Source to Target

> [Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/)

## Approach

- **Time Complexity: O(N * 2^N)**

2^(n-2) path from start to destination where n is the number of node. For each path, there could be at most N-2 intermediate nodes.

- **Space Complexity: O(N * 2^N)**

the space we need to store the results would be O(N * 2^N)

Since we also applied recursion in the algorithm, the recursion could incur additional memory consumption in the function call stack. The stack can grow up to NN consecutive calls. Meanwhile, along with the recursive call, we also keep the state of the current path, which could take another O(N) space. Therefore, in total, the recursion would require additional O(N) space.

```python
class Solution:
    def allPathsSourceTarget(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        self.target = len(graph) - 1
        res = []
        self.dfs(graph, 0, res, [0])
        return res
    
    def dfs(self, graph, current, res, path):
        if current == self.target:
            res.append(path)
            return
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            self.dfs(graph, neighbor, res, path+[neighbor])
```

if want to use append and pop, should:

```python
class Solution:
    def allPathsSourceTarget(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        self.target = len(graph) - 1
        self.res = []
        self.dfs(graph, 0, [0])
        return self.res
    
    def dfs(self, graph, current, path):
        if current == self.target:
            # pay attention to this line
            self.res.append(list(tuple(path)))
            return
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            path.append(neighbor)
            self.dfs(graph, neighbor, path)
            path.pop()
```

wrong version:

```python
class Solution:
    def allPathsSourceTarget(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        self.target = len(graph) - 1
        self.res = []
        self.dfs(graph, 0, [0])
        return self.res
    
    def dfs(self, graph, current, path):
        if current == self.target:
            print("path to add is", path)
            print("res before added is", self.res)
            self.res.append(path)
            print("res after added is", self.res)
            return
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            path.append(neighbor)
            self.dfs(graph, neighbor, path)
            path.pop()
            print("path now", path)
```
will lead to:

```
path to add is [0, 1, 3]
res before added is []
res after added is [[0, 1, 3]]
path now [0, 1]
path now [0]
path to add is [0, 2, 3]
res before added is [[0, 2, 3]]
res after added is [[0, 2, 3], [0, 2, 3]]
path now [0, 2]
path now [0]
```

guessing wrong because the path is changing during recursion.
