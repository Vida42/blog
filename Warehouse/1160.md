## Approach

- **Time Complexity: O(N)**

- **Space Complexity: O(N)**

```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def countCharacters(self, words: List[str], chars: str) -> int:
        lookup = Counter(chars)
        res = 0
        for each in words:
            tmp = Counter(each)
            mark = True
            for char in tmp:
                if tmp[char] > lookup[char]:
                    mark = False
                    break
            if mark:
                res += len(each)
        return res
```

```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def countCharacters(self, words: List[str], chars: str) -> int:
        lookup = Counter(chars)
        res = 0
        for each in words:
            tmp = Counter(each)
            if all(tmp[char] <= lookup[char] for char in tmp):
                res += len(each)
        return res
```

## Conclusion

too simple, FINALE
