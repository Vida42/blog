# 1192. Critical Connections in a Network

## Approach : Tarjan's bridge-finding algorithm

Wow, critical connection. network science.

- **Time Complexity: O(|E|)**

DFS time complexity is O(|E| + |V|), attempting to visit each edge at most twice. (the second attempt will immediately return.)
As the graph is always a connected graph, |E| >= |V|.

- **Space Complexity: O(|E|)**

Space complexity = O(graph) + O(rank) + O(connections) = 3 * O(|E| + |V|) = O(|E|).

```python
class Solution:
    def criticalConnections(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # time: 0->1->2->3...
        # node and their neighbor
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        # order of DFS level
        curVisitTime = 0
        # the lowest order of vertex that can reach vertex i
        lowestVisitTime = [i for i in range(n)]
        visited = [False for _ in range(n)]
        
        # build graph:
        for edge in connections:
            graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
            graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
        
        res = []
        prevVertex = -1 ## we need to know where the current DFS level comes from.         
        curV = 0 ## we start the DFS from vertex 0
        self._dfs(res, graph, lowestVisitTime, visited, curVisitTime, -1, 0)
        return res
    
    def _dfs(self, res, graph, lowestVisitTime, visited, curVisitTime, preV, curV):

        visited[curV] = True 
        lowestVisitTime[curV] = curVisitTime

        for nextV in graph[curV]:
            # since it's undirected, pass neighbor prev
            if nextV == preV:
                continue

            if not visited[nextV]:
                self._dfs(res, graph, lowestVisitTime, visited, curVisitTime + 1, curV, nextV)

            lowestVisitTime[curV] = min(lowestVisitTime[curV], lowestVisitTime[nextV]) 
            # take the min of the current vertex's and nextV vertex's ranking
            if lowestVisitTime[nextV] > curVisitTime:
                # if there is only one way to rech nextV from curV
                res.append([curV, nextV])
```


## Conclusion

[Tarjan algorithm](https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/discuss/410345/Python-\(98-Time-100-Memory\)-clean-solution-with-explanaions-for-confused-people-like-me)

and [This](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/101923309)

We do DFS traversal of the given graph. In DFS tree an edge (u, v) (u is parent of v in DFS tree) is bridge if there does not exist any other alternative to reach u or an ancestor of u from subtree rooted with v. As discussed in the previous post, the value low[v] indicates earliest visited vertex reachable from subtree rooted with v. The condition for an edge (u, v) to be a bridge is, “low[v] > disc[u]”.
