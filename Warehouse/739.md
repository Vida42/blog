# 739. Daily Temperatures

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-%23f0ad4e)

> Description
> 
> Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

## Approach


- **Time Complexity: O(N)**


- **Space Complexity: O(N)**

from right to left

```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, T: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [0] * len(T)
        stack = []
        for i in range(len(T)-1, -1, -1):
            while stack and T[stack[-1]] <= T[i]:
                stack.pop()
            if stack:
                res[i] = stack[-1] - i
            stack.append(i)
        return res
```

## Note

from left to right

```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, T: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [0] * len(T)
        stack = []
        for i in range(len(T)):
            while stack and T[stack[-1]] < T[i]:
                res[stack[-1]] = i - stack[-1]
                stack.pop()
            stack.append(i)
        return res
```

notice didn't makeany note when I did it.
