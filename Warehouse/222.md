## Approach : DFS

- **Time Complexity: O(N)**

- **Space Complexity: O(H)**

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        return self.dfs(root)
    
    def dfs(self, node):
        if not node:
            return 0
        return 1 + self.dfs(node.left) + self.dfs(node.right)
```

## Approach : Binary Search

- **Time Complexity: O(log n * log n)**

To find number of layers we need O(log n). We also need O(log n) iterations for binary search, on each of them we reach the bottom layer in O(log n). So, overall time complexity is O(log n * log n).

- **Space Complexity: O(log n)**

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        # if the tree is empty
        if not root:
            return 0
        d = self.depthCompute(root)
        # if the tree contains 1 node
        if d == 0:
            return 1
        # at least 1 node, at most 2**d nodes
        left, right = 1, 2**d -1
        while left <= right:
            # max of left would be right+1==2**d
            # min of lef would be 1 when there is 1 node
            # (mark 1 means 2nd node)
            mid = left + (right-left)//2
            if self.exists(root, mid, d):
                left = mid + 1
                # mid exist, so calculate mid+1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        # The tree contains 2**d - 1 nodes on the first (d - 1) levels
        # and left nodes on the last level.
        return 2**d - 1 + left
    
    def depthCompute(self, node):
        d = 0
        while node.left:
            node = node.left
            d += 1
        return d
    
    def exists(self, node, idx, d):
        # mark 1st node on last level as 0
        # mark last node on last level as 2**d-1
        # min of idx is 1, max of idx is 2**d-1
        left, right = 0, 2**d-1
        for _ in range(d):
            # go down d times
            mid = left + (right-left)//2
            if idx <= mid:
                node = node.left
                right = mid
            else:
                node = node.right
                left = mid + 1
        return node is not None
```

## Conclusion

Solution of this question is a good article.

**not (left + right)/2 to [avoid overflow](https://ai.googleblog.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html)**
