## Approach

- **constructor: O(K)**

- **add(): O(1)**

- **showFirstUnique(): O(1) (amortized)**

For this implementation, the showFirstUnique() method needs to iterate down the queue until it finds a unique number. For each unique number it encounters along the way, it removes it. Removing an item from a queue has a cost of O(1). The total number of these removals we need to carry out is proportional to the number of calls to add(), because each add() corresponds to at most one removal that will ultimately have to happen. Then when we find a unique number, it is an O(1) operation to return it.

Because the number of O(1) removals is proportional to the number of calls to add(), we say that the time complexity amortizes across all calls to add() and showFirstUnique(), giving an overall time complexity of O(1) (amortized).

- **Space Complexity: O(N)**: one in queue one in hashmap

```python
from collections import deque
class FirstUnique:

    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.queue = deque()
        self.hashMap = dict()
        for num in nums:
            self.add(num)

    def showFirstUnique(self) -> int:
        while self.queue and not self.hashMap[self.queue[0]]:
            self.queue.popleft()
        if self.queue:
            return self.queue[0]
        return -1

    def add(self, value: int) -> None:
        if value not in self.hashMap:
            self.hashMap[value] = True
            self.queue.append(value)
        else:
            self.hashMap[value] = False


# Your FirstUnique object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = FirstUnique(nums)
# param_1 = obj.showFirstUnique()
# obj.add(value)
```
