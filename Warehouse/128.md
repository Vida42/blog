## Approach 1 : Sort:baby_bottle:🍼

- **Time Complexity: O(nlogn)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        nums.sort()
        res = tmp = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            if nums[i+1] == nums[i] + 1:
                tmp += 1
            elif nums[i+1] == nums[i]:
                continue
            else:
                res = max(res, tmp)
                tmp = 1
        res = max(res, tmp)
        return res
```

first `[0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]` expected 9 got 1, so added
```python
res = max(res, tmp)
```
after loop.

then `[]` expected 0 got 1, so added
```python
        if not nums:
            return 0
```


then `[1,2,0,1]` expected 3 got 2, so added
```python
            elif nums[i+1] == nums[i]:
                continue
```

## Approach 2 : HashSet

the numbers are stored in a HashSet to allow O(1) lookups

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**

Although the time complexity appears to be quadratic due to the `while` loop nested within the `for` loop, closer inspection reveals it to be linear. Because the `while` loop is reached only when `currentNum` marks the beginning of a sequence (i.e. `currentNum-1` is not present in `nums`), the `while` loop can only run for nn iterations throughout the entire runtime of the algorithm. This means that despite looking like O(n⋅n) complexity, the nested loops actually run in O(n + n) = O(n) time. All other computations occur in constant time, so the overall runtime is linear.

- **Space Complexity: O(n)**

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        lookup = set(nums)
        res = 0
        
        for each in lookup:
            # when it's new beginning
            if each - 1 not in lookup:
                current = each
                tmp = 1
                
                while current + 1 in lookup:
                    current += 1
                    tmp += 1
                res = max(res, tmp)
        return res
```

## Conclusion

So here comes the time-space tradeoff. when n is not big, nlogn didn't differ significantly from n in terms of time. if the list is very long, it will cost more space but with less time.
