## Approach : Counter

- **Time Complexity: O(N)**

- **Space Complexity: O(26)**

26 is the size of key

inspired by [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorganize-string/discuss/232469/Java-No-Sort-O\(N\)-0ms-beat-100)

```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def reorganizeString(self, S: str) -> str:
        lookup = Counter(S)
        char = max(lookup, key=lambda x:lookup[x])
        if lookup[char] > (len(S)+1)/2:
            return ""
        res = [''] * len(S)
        idx = 0
        while lookup[char] > 0:
            res[idx] = char
            idx += 2
            lookup[char] -= 1
        for char in lookup:
            while lookup[char] > 0:
                if idx >= len(S):
                    idx = 1
                res[idx] = char
                idx += 2
                lookup[char] -= 1
        return "".join(res)
```

## Approach : Counter then Heap

same complexity, just diff when generate final res, refer [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorganize-string/discuss/113457/Simple-python-solution-using-PriorityQueue)

```python
from collections import Counter
import heapq
class Solution:
    def reorganizeString(self, S: str) -> str:
        lookup = Counter(S)
        res = ""
        heap = [(-c,k) for k, c in lookup.items()]
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        preCount, preChar = 0, ''
        while heap:
            count, char = heapq.heappop(heap)
            res += char
            if preCount < 0:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (preCount, preChar))
            count += 1
            preCount, preChar = count, char
        
        return "" if len(res) != len(S) else res
```

## Conclusion

In essence, Counter.
