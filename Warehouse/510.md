# 510. Inorder Successor in BST II

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-%23f0ad4e)

> Description
> 
> Given a node in a binary search tree, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST. You will have direct access to the node but not to the root of the tree. Each node will have a reference to its parent node.

## Approach

- **Time Complexity: O(H)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

so now I know that thought in 450 is not a proper way to find successor, and it's iteration.

```python
class Solution:
    def inorderSuccessor(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not node.right:
            while node.parent:
                if node.parent.val < node.val:
                    node = node.parent
                else:
                    return node.parent
            return node.parent
        node = node.right
        while node.left:
            node = node.left
        return node
```
