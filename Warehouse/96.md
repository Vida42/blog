## Approach : [DP](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/solution/)

- **Time Complexity: O(N^2)**

- **Space Complexity: O(N)**

```python
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
        G = [0] * (n+1)
        G[0] = 1
        G[1] = 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            for j in range(1, i+1):
                G[i] += G[j-1] * G[i-j]
        return G[n]
```

## Approach 2: Mathematical Deduction


the sequence of G(n) function results is known as Catalan number. And one of the more convenient forms for calculation is defined as follows:

C_0 = 1, \qquad C_{n+1} = 2(2n+1)//(n+2) * C_{n}
â€‹
```python
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
        c = 1
        for i in range(n):
            c = c * 2 * (2*i+1) // (i+2)
        return c
```

## Conclusion

totally don't know what to do until see solution.
