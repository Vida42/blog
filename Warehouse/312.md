## Approach

- **Time Complexity: O(N^3)**

- **Space Complexity: O(N^2)**

```python
class Solution:
    def maxCoins(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        # reframe problem as before
        nums = [1] + nums + [1]
        n = len(nums)

        # dp will store the results of our calls
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

        # iterate over dp and incrementally build up to dp[0][n-1]
        for left in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            for right in range(left+2, n):
                # same formula to get the best score from (left, right) as before
                dp[left][right] = max(nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] + dp[left][i] + dp[i][right] for i in range(left+1, right))

        return dp[0][n-1]
```
