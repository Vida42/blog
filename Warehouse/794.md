## Approach

there are two situaion of FALSE:

not win & number of XO is incorrect

win and number of XO is incorrect

- **Time Complexity: O(1)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def validTicTacToe(self, board: List[str]) -> bool:
        x = sum(row.count('X') for row in board)
        o = sum(row.count('O') for row in board)
        if o != x-1 and o != x:
            return False
        if self.win(board, 'X') and x-1 != o:
            # ["XXX","   ","OOO"]
            return False
        if self.win(board, 'O') and x != o:
            return False

        return True

    def win(self, board, char):
        # eight situations of win:
            # 3 for col direction
            # 3 for row direction
            # 2 for diagnal direction
        for i in range(3):
            if all(board[i][j] == char for j in range(3)):
                return True
            if all(board[j][i] == char for j in range(3)):
                return True
        if char == board[1][1] == board[0][0] == board[2][2]:
            return True
        if char == board[1][1] == board[0][2] == board[2][0]:
            return True
        return False
```

## Conclusion

just statistic question, meaningless, FINALE
