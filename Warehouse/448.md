# 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-%235cb85c)

> Description
> 
> Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once. Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

## Approach 1 : hashmap:baby_bottle:🍼

creat dict contains element from 1 to n, then add element in nums to dict, return those whose value is 0.

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**


- **Space Complexity: O(n)**

```python
class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        dic = dict()
        res = []
        for i in range(1, len(nums)+1):
            dic[i] = 0
        for i in nums:
            dic[i] += 1
        for i in dic:
            if dic[i] == 0:
                res.append(i)
        return res
```

## Approach 2 : array in place

similar to 442, this time to distiguish those who do not appear from those who appear twice, we negate element when they haven't been negated.

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**


- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def findDisappearedNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        for i in nums:
            if nums[abs(i)-1] > 0:
                nums[abs(i)-1] *= -1

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > 0:
                res.append(i+1)
        return res
```
