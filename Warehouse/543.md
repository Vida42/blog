# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-%235cb85c)

> Description
> 
> Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

## Approach

I know the key to this question is for each node, to get the height of left side and height of right side and calculate the sum, then find which node has the maximum number, the maximum is the answer. But for my first try I failed to get the answer.

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**

visit every node once.

- **Space Complexity: O(n)**

the size of our implicit call stack during our depth-first search.


```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.res = 0
        self.dfs(root)
        return self.res
    
    def dfs(self, node):
        if not node:
            return
        self.dfs(node.left)
        self.res = max(self.res, self.height(node))
        self.dfs(node.right)
        
    def height(self, node):
        if not node:
            return 0
        elif not node.left:
            return self.height(node.right) + 1
        elif not node.right:
            return self.height(node.left) + 1
        else:
            return self.height(node.left) + self.height(node.right) + 2
```

Then by viewing others' solution, I realized we just need to calculate the depth of a node in the usual way, just remember the highest number of nodes used in some path. The desired length is 1 minus this number.


```python
def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
    self.res = 1
    self.height(root)
    return self.res - 1

def height(self, node):
    if not node:
        return 0
    l = self.height(node.left)
    r = self.height(node.right)
    self.res = max(self.res, l+r+1)
    return max(l, r) + 1
```

In the answer above, height function returns the count of nodes in that path. And the number of edges is number of nodes minus 1

If you treat left and right as path, you know that the path is the depth of the left subtree plus the depth of the right subtree, so you just add them and there is no need to subtract from res.

```python
self.ans = 0
def depth(root):
    if not root: return 0
    left = depth(root.left)
    right = depth(root.right)
    # path
    self.ans = max(self.ans, left + right)
    # depth
    return max(left, right) + 1
 depth(root)
 return self.ans
```
