> Given a positive integer N, how many ways can we write it as a sum of consecutive positive integers?

## Approach

Math problem, here is the solution:

N = (x+1) + ... + (x+k)

  = xk + k(k+1)/2

so, x = N/k - (k+1)/2 where 1). x >= 0, 2). x is an integer

so, N/k >= (k+1)/2

2N + 1/4 >= (k + 1/2)^2

k <= sqrt(2N + 1/4) - 1/2

so we iterate from 1 to sqrt(2N + 1/4) - 1/2, to find N/k - (k+1)/2 is an integer

- **Time Complexity: O(n^1/2)**

> it's to find all possible pairs of k and 2x + k + 1 which are both divisors of a number 2N, so sqrt(2n) == sqrt(n)

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**


```python
import math
class Solution:
    def consecutiveNumbersSum(self, N: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        upperBound = int(math.sqrt(2*N+1/4)-1/2)+1
        for k in range(1, upperBound):
            x = N/k-(k+1)/2
            if x%1 == 0:
                res += 1
        return res
```

## Conclusion

数学题还很高频？upperBound+1 due to range
