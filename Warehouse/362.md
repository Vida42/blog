# 362. Design Hit Counter

## Approach 1 : List


- **Time Complexity**

O(1) for hit, O(n) for getHits

- **Space Complexity: O(N)**

```python
class HitCounter:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.stack = []
        self.counts = 0
        
    def hit(self, timestamp: int) -> None:
        """
        Record a hit.
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity).
        """
        self.stack.append(timestamp)    

    def getHits(self, timestamp: int) -> int:
        """
        Return the number of hits in the past 5 minutes.
        @param timestamp - The current timestamp (in seconds granularity).
        """
        while self.stack:
            if (timestamp - self.stack[0]) >= 300:
                self.stack.pop(0)
            else:
                break
        return len(self.stack)

```

I think solution above won't appear in real question because you may be asked about a small timestamp gethit() query when you reach a big timestamp hit().
