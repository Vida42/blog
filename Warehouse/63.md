## Approach

- **Time Complexity: O(MN)**

- **Space Complexity: O(MN)**

transaction function is [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/discuss/146073/Python-DP-beat-100-python-submissions)

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        dp = [[0]*len(obstacleGrid[0]) for _ in range(len(obstacleGrid))]
        dp[0][0] = 1 if obstacleGrid[0][0] == 0 else 0

        for i in range(len(obstacleGrid)):
            for j in range(len(obstacleGrid[0])):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1:
                    dp[i][j] = 0
                else:
                    if i-1>=0:
                        dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]
                    if j-1>=0:
                         dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1]
        return dp[-1][-1]
```

we can also build first row and first col just like what we did in 44.

code below refer [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/discuss/23410/Python-different-solutions-\(O\(m*n\)-O\(n\)-in-place\).)

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not obstacleGrid:
            return 
        m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        dp[0][0] = 1 if obstacleGrid[0][0] == 0 else 0
        
        for i in range(1, m):
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] * (1 - obstacleGrid[i][0])
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[0][i] = dp[0][i-1] * (1 - obstacleGrid[0][i])

        for row in range(1, m):
            for col in range(1, n):
                if obstacleGrid[row][col] == 1:
                    dp[row][col] = 0
                else:
                    dp[row][col] = dp[row-1][col] + dp[row][col-1]

        return dp[-1][-1]
```

## Conclusion

solution has O(1) space method, just modify the original matrix
