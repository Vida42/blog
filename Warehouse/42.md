## Approach 1: Brute Force




- **Time Complexity: O()**

- **Space Complexity: O()**



```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0 
        for i in range(1, len(height)-1):
            h = height[i]
            left = max(height[:i])
            right = max(height[i+1:])
            if min(left, right) > h:
                res += min(left, right) - h
        return res
```

## Approach 2




- **Time Complexity: O()**

- **Space Complexity: O()**



```python

## Approach 3: [Two pointers](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/discuss/17357/Sharing-my-simple-c%2B%2B-code%3A-O\(n\)-time-O\(1\)-space)

画图走了一遍才看懂

```

arr[left] or arr[right] always is a pointer to a value which is the max value found so far, searching from left and right.

If arr[left] <= arr[right], this means that arr[right] is the max value found so far. This also means that maxLeft will be less than or equal to arr[right], which means that maxLeft will be bounding the addition to the answer(res variable, in this solution), since it has be less than or equal to arr[right] e, so we don't have to consider maxRight when adding to the counter.

If arr[left] > arr[right] , this means at arr[left] is the max value found so far. Same thing applies as explained in the paragraph above.
```

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**



```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        maxLeft, maxRight = 0, 0
        sums = 0

        while left <= right:
            if height[left] <= height[right]:
                if height[left] >= maxLeft:
                    maxLeft = height[left]
                else:
                    sums = sums + maxLeft - height[left]
                left += 1
            else:
                if height[right] >= maxRight:
                    maxRight = height[right]
                else:
                    sums = sums + maxRight - height[right]
                right -= 1
        return sums
