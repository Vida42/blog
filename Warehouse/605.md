## Approach

Firstly try to use math, but it will have many edge cases like [0,0,1,0,1]

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        idxs = [-1]
        res = 0
        for idx, val in enumerate(flowerbed):
            if val == 1:
                idxs.append(idx)
        idxs.append(idx+1)
        for i in range(len(idxs)-1):
            diff = idxs[i+1] - idxs[i] - 1
            if diff == 0:
                # (0-1)//2 would be -1
                continue
            res += (diff-1)//2
            print(diff)
        return True if res >= n else False
```

- **Time Complexity: O(N)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        i = 0
        count = 0
        while i < len(flowerbed):
            if flowerbed[i] == 0 and (i==0 or flowerbed[i-1]==0) and (i==len(flowerbed)-1 or flowerbed[i+1]==0):
                flowerbed[i] = 1
                count += 1
            i += 1
            if count >= n:
                return True
        return False
```

- **Time Complexity: O(N)**

- **Space Complexity: O(N)**

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        count = 0
        f = [0] + flowerbed + [0]
        for i in range(1, len(f)-1):
            if f[i-1] == f[i] == f[i+1]:
                f[i] = 1
                count += 1
            if count >= n:
                return True
        return False
```

## Conclusion
