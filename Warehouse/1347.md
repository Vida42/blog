# 1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-%23f0ad4e)

> Description
> 
> Given two equal-size strings s and t. In one step you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character. Return the minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of s.

> An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

## Approach

using hashmap to store frequency info of one string

then iterate another string to get answer(if freq of cur char less than 1, replace++)

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        lookup = Counter(s)
        res = 0
        for i in t:
            if lookup[i] > 0:
                lookup[i] -= 1
            else:
                res += 1
        return res
```

or since they has same length, count freq simultaneously, then sum all > 0 or sum all < 0.

```python
class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        dic = [0] * 26
        for i in range(len(s)):
            dic[ord(s[i]) - ord('a')] += 1
            dic[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1
        return sum(i for i in dic if i > 0)
```

> 但是更慢了

## Conclusion

低频，anagram多用到hashmap
