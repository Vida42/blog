## Approach

- **Time Complexity: O(T)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        lenS, lenT = len(s), len(t)

        left = right = 0
        while left < lenS and right < lenT:
            # move both pointers or just the right pointer
            if s[left] == t[right]:
                left += 1
            right += 1

        return left == lenS
```

## Approach : Greedy Match with Character Indices Hashmap

> Follow up: If there are lots of incoming S, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

- **Time Complexity: O(T+SlogT)**

- **Space Complexity: O(T)**

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:

        letter_indices_table = defaultdict(list)
        for index, letter in enumerate(t):
            letter_indices_table[letter].append(index)

        curr_match_index = -1
        for letter in s:
            if letter not in letter_indices_table:
                return False  # no match at all, early exit

            # greedy match with binary search
            indices_list = letter_indices_table[letter]
            match_index = bisect.bisect_right(indices_list, curr_match_index)
            if match_index != len(indices_list):
                curr_match_index = indices_list[match_index]
            else:
                return False # no suitable match found, early exist

        return True
```
