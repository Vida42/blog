# 953.Verifying an Alien Dictionary

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-%235cb85c)

> Description
> 
> Given a sequence of words written in the alien language(a different order of the alphabet), and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

## Approach 1 : custom sort

- **Time Complexity: O(nlogn)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def isAlienSorted(self, words: List[str], order: str) -> bool:
        out = sorted(words, key = lambda x : [order.index(i) for i in x])
        return out == words
```

## Approach 2 : hashmap

Build a transform mapping from order, transform all word to normal order, then check if all words are in sorted order.

- **Time Complexity: O(NC)**

N is the length of words since we go through the words list to compare each string with its previous one in all().
C is the max length of word in the words list.

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**


```python
class Solution:
    def isAlienSorted(self, words: List[str], order: str) -> bool:
        mapping = {letter : i for i, letter in enumerate(order)}
        words = [[mapping[each] for each in word] for word in words]
        return all(words[i] <= words[i+1] for i in range(len(words)-1))
```

## Conclusion

[Definition of a lexicographical order?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47478926/definition-of-a-lexicographical-order/47479028#47479028)

- If two words have the same first letter, we compare the second. If the second letters are the same, we compare the third, etc. Finally, one word comes before the other if the first differing letter comes before the corresponding letter.

- If two words are identical up to the length of the shorter word, the shorter word comes first.

- The `all()` function returns True if all items in an iterable are true, otherwise it returns False. If the iterable object is empty, the all() function also returns True.
