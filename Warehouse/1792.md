## Approach

### Thought



### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity: O(M * logN + N)**

> where M is extra students and N is number if classes. O(N) to build heap

- **Space Complexity: O(N)**

>

### Code

```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def maxAverageRatio(self, classes: List[List[int]], extraStudents: int) -> float:
        heap = []
        for each in classes:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-self.diff(each[0], each[1]), each[0], each[1]))
            # maintain a maxheap whose top is the one has largest increament
        count = extraStudents
        while count != 0:
            diffOld, pas, total = heapq.heappop(heap)
            tmp = (-self.diff(pas+1, total+1), pas+1, total+1)
            heapq.heappush(heap, tmp)
            count -= 1
        return sum([each[1]/each[2] for each in heap])/len(heap)
    
    def diff(self, pas, total):
        return (pas+1)/(total+1) - pas/total
