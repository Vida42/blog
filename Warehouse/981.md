## Approach


- **Time Complexity**

O(1) for each set operation, and O(\log N)O(logN) for each get.

- **Space Complexity: O(N)**

```python
class TimeMap:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.mySet = collections.defaultdict(list)

    def set(self, key: str, value: str, timestamp: int) -> None:
        self.mySet[key].append((timestamp, value))

    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: int) -> str:
        res = self.mySet.get(key, None)
        if not res:
            return ""
        
        n = len(res)
        left = 0
        right = n
        
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if res[mid][0] <= timestamp:
                left = mid + 1
            elif res[mid][0] > timestamp:
                right = mid
        
        if right == 0:
            return ""
        else:
            return res[mid][1]


# Your TimeMap object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = TimeMap()
# obj.set(key,value,timestamp)
# param_2 = obj.get(key,timestamp)
```
