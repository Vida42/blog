## Approach

- **Time Complexity: O(MNN)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    for k in range(n):
                        if matrix[i][k] != 0:
                            matrix[i][k] = float('inf')
                    for k in range(m):
                        if matrix[k][j] != 0:
                            matrix[k][j] = float('inf')
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == float('inf'):
                    matrix[i][j] = 0
```
## Approach

- **Time Complexity: O(MN)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

above version is bad, this is what we want

                matrix[0][j] = 0
        if row_zero:
            for i in range(m):

```

## Conclusion

O(MN) space is easy to get: create new and assign
O(M+N) space is to store location of 0 and assign
