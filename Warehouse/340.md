## Approach

we can use template in [76](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/discuss/26808/Here-is-a-10-line-template-that-can-solve-most-'substring'-problems)

- **Time Complexity: O(N)**

- **Space Complexity: O(k)**

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        if not s:
            return 0
        left, right, maxLength, required = 0, 0, 0, 0
        lookup = defaultdict(int)
        
        while right < len(s):
            char = s[right]
            if lookup[char] == 0:
                required += 1
            lookup[char] += 1
            right += 1
            
            while required > k:
                char = s[left]
                if lookup[char] == 1:
                    required -= 1
                lookup[char] -= 1
                left += 1
            maxLength = max(maxLength, right-left)
        
        return maxLength
```
