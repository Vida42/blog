# 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-%23f0ad4e)

> Description
> 
> Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once. Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

> Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?

## Approach 1 : dict:baby_bottle:🍼

naive solution.

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**

- **Space Complexity: O(n)**

```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def findDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        lookup = Counter(nums)
        res = []
        for each in lookup:
            if lookup[each] > 1:
                res.append(each)
        return res
```

## Approach 2 : Mark Visited Elements in the Input Array itself

> [speachless, so clever](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/solution/)

using this information:
```
The integers in the input array arr satisfy 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n, where n is the size of array.
```

this means for integer `x` in the array, `x-1` is a valid index.

Thus we have algorithm:

1. Iterate over the array and for every element `x` in the array, negate the value at index `abs(x)-1`.
    - The negation operation effectively marks the value abs(x) as seen / visited.

2. Iterate over the array again, for every element `x` in the array:
    - If the value at index `abs(x)-1` is positive, it must have been negated twice. Thus `abs(x)` must have appeared twice in the array. We add `abs(x)` to the result.
    - In the above case, when we reach the second occurrence of `abs(x)`, we need to avoid fulfilling this condition again. So, we'll additionally negate the value at index `abs(x)-1`.


- **Time Complexity: O(n)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        for i in nums:
            nums[abs(i)-1] *= -1
        print(nums)
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > 0:
                res.append(i+1)
                nums[i] *= -1
        return res
```

Above is wrong, because teh second round may got wrong element like 8. We should go as first round again(using index as element again).

```
input:  [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
nums after negation:    [-4, 3, 2, -7, 8, 2, -3, -1]
output: [2,3,5,6]
expected:   [2,3]
```


```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        for i in nums:
            nums[abs(i)-1] *= -1
        for i in nums:
            if nums[abs(i)-1] > 0:
                res.append(abs(i))
                nums[abs(i)-1] *= -1
        return res
```
