THE DESCRIPTION SUCKS

it means giving a array x=[a,b,c], pick an idex of array, and the probability of one index i should be x[i]/sum(x).


## Approach

It's still very similar to 1060, diff is now we use prefix sum instead of diff.

say we have [1,2,3,4], the prefix sum is [1,3,6,10].

**we can find** the diff of prefix suum is just the probability:
```
1/10, 2/10, 2/10, 4/10
```

first we random generate a number between 1 and 10, then the wider the gap, the higher prob the border of the gap will be chosen.

we use right gap since it represents heavier weight.

similarly we can linear search, leave it out here.

- **Time Complexity: O(logN)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:

    def __init__(self, w: List[int]):
        self.nums = []
        sums = 0
        for each in w:
            sums += each
            self.nums.append(sums)

    def pickIndex(self) -> int:
        target = random.randrange(1, self.nums[-1] + 1)
        # target = self.nums[-1] * random.random()
        lo, hi = 0, len(self.nums)-1
        while lo < hi:
            mid = lo + (hi-lo)//2
            if self.nums[mid] < target:
                lo = mid+1
            else:
                hi = mid
        return hi
        


# Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Solution(w)
# param_1 = obj.pickIndex()
```

## Conclusion


Though I still don't understand why `lo+1<hi and lo=mid return hi` won't work.
