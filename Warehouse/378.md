## Approach

fuck, I'm stupid, I can use heap to implement my thought.

- **Time Complexity: O(X + Klog(X))**

let X=min(K,N)

- **Space Complexity: O(X)**

which is occupied by the heap

```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        minHeap = []
        n = len(matrix)
        for r in range(min(k, n)):
            minHeap.append((matrix[r][0], r, 0))
        heapq.heapify(minHeap)
        
        while k:
            cur, row, col = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            if col < n-1:
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, (matrix[row][col+1], row, col+1))
            k -= 1
            
        return cur
```

## Note

```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        minHeap = []
        # if k < len, means we only need to find in first k row
        # else we need to add all n row into minHeap
        n = len(matrix)
        for i in range(min(k, n)):
            # append value at row r, col c with r and c
            minHeap.append((matrix[i][0], i, 0))
        heapq.heapify(minHeap)
        
        while k:
            # get current smllest element
            cur, row, col = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            # if this row has element not view
            if col < n-1:
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, (matrix[row][col+1], row, col+1))
            # else means we've view all element this row and popped them out
            # counter
            k -= 1
        
        return cur
```
