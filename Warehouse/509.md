> return nth number in Fibonacci sequence, 0<= n <= 30

## Approach 1 : Recursion

This is the slowest way.

- **Time Complexity: O(2^n)**

call the function 2^(n-1) + 1 times for n

T(n) approximately equal to 2T(n-1)
...
T(2) = 2T(1)

so, T(n) = 2^(n-1) T(1)

- **Space Complexity: O(n)**

We need space proportionate to N to account for the max size of the stack, in memory.


```python
class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        return self.fib(n-1) + self.fib(n-2)
```

## Approach 2 : Iterative Bottom-Up Approach

this naive way is even faster than approach 1

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**


```python
class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        
        cur, prev1, prev2 = 0, 0, 1
        
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            cur = prev1 + prev2
            prev1 = prev2
            prev2 = cur
        
        return cur
```

## Conclusion

there are four other ways in [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/solution/):

Bottom-Up Approach using Memoization(n, n)
Top-Down Approach using Memoization(n, n)
Matrix Exponentiation(logn, logn)
math(1, 1): which is not enough when n is big

# Finale

Leave (n, n) method alone

```python
```python
class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        cur, prev1, prev2 = 0, 0, 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            cur = prev1 + prev2
            prev1 = prev2
            prev2 = cur
        return cur
```
