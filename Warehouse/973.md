# 973. K Closest Points to Origin

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-%23f0ad4e)

> Description
> 
> We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).

## Approach 1 : Custom Sort

- **Time Complexity: O(nlogn)**

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
# 83.17% , 87.95%
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], K: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        points.sort(key=lambda x: x[0]**2+x[1]**2)
        for i in range(K):
            res.append(points[i])
        return res
```

## Approach 2 : Min Heap

- **Time Complexity: O(N) + O(KlogN)**

- **Space Complexity: O(N)**

```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], K: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        distances = [(p[0] ** 2 + p[1] ** 2, p[0], p[1]) for p in points]
        heapq.heapify(distances)
        res = []
        for _ in range(K):
            _, x, y = heapq.heappop(distances)
            res.append((x, y))
        return res
```

## Approach 3 : Max Heap

- **Time Complexity: O(NlogK)**

- **Space Complexity: O(N)**

```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], K: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        min_heap = []
        for p in points:
            eucl_dist = p[0] ** 2 + p[1] ** 2
            if len(min_heap) < K:
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (-eucl_dist, p[0], p[1]))
            else:
                heapq.heappushpop(min_heap, (-eucl_dist, p[0], p[1]))
        
        res = []
        for i in range(K):
            xy_tuple = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            res.append([xy_tuple[1], xy_tuple[2]])
        return res
```

## Conclusion

see in the [solution area](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/solution/)

For approach 2, I thought big O for building heap is klog(k) ---- maintain k size and adjust log(k) for each pop, but it's wrong.

For min heap:

it is O(N) + O(KlogN), because you have a min heap with N element first, and pop an element out from the heap each time for K times.

For max heap:

You have an empty max heap of size K, and each time you push an element into the max heap, if we exceed the max size K, we pop the maximum element out from the heap. So the complexity is O(K) + O((N-K)logK) + O(K).

O(K) for building heap, O((N-K)logK) for iterating the list and adjust heap, then O(K) to iterate heap to get result, so O(NlogK) in the end.


#### Also, heap can insert turples, but no way to custom.
