# 1041. Robot Bounded In Circle

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-%23f0ad4e)

> Description
> 
> given instructions to a robot, and repeats them forever. Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

## Approach


- **Time Complexity: O(N)**


- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def isRobotBounded(self, instructions: str) -> bool:
        # north = 0, east = 1, south = 2, west = 3
        directions = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]]
        # Initial position is in the center
        x = y = 0
        # facing north
        idx = 0
        
        for i in instructions:
            if i == "L":
                idx = (idx + 3) % 4
            elif i == "R":
                idx = (idx + 1) % 4
            else:
                x += directions[idx][0]
                y += directions[idx][1]
        
        # after one cycle:
        # robot returns into initial position
        # or robot doesn't face north
        return (x == 0 and y == 0) or idx != 0
```

or

```python
        x, y, dx, dy = 0, 0, 0, 1
        for i in instructions:
            if i == 'R': dx, dy = dy, -dx
            if i == 'L': dx, dy = -dy, dx
            if i == 'G': x, y = x + dx, y + dy
        return (x, y) == (0, 0) or (dx, dy) != (0,1)
```

## Conclusion

The first solution to adjust direction is smart. The second version run faster.
