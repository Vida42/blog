# 31. Next Permutation

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-%23f0ad4e)

> Description
> 
> Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers. If such an arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order.

## Approach


- **Time Complexity: O(N)**


- **Space Complexity: O(1)**

```python
class Solution:
    def nextPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        cur = len(nums) - 2
        while cur >= 0 and nums[cur+1] <= nums[cur]:
            cur -= 1

        if cur >= 0:
            replace = len(nums) - 1
            while replace >= 0 and nums[replace] <= nums[cur]:
                replace -= 1
            nums[cur], nums[replace] = nums[replace], nums[cur]
        nums[cur+1:] = nums[cur+1:][::-1]
```


## Conclusion

First, I spent several minutes to understand what this question is asking about. Then finally know it treats a list as one item, then compares each element of two items lexicographically(as number) to decide the order of these two items(see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58859316/next-permutation-definition)).

Then, after reading solution article, I understand why people in Comments complain it shouldn't be in an interview, it's too hard to find the pattern(or algorithm, algorithm for this question only).
