# 346. Moving Average from Data Stream

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-%235cb85c)

> Description
> 
> Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

## Approach

Using Array or Double-ended Queue

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**

pop first cost O(n), n is size

- **Time Complexity: O(1)**

if using code commented, i.e. deque, pop would be O(1) thus Time Complexity would be O(1)

- **Space Complexity: O(n)**


```python
# from collections import deque
class MovingAverage:

    def __init__(self, size: int):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.window = []
        # self.window = deque()
        self.size = size
        self.length = 0
        self.sums = 0
        

    def next(self, val: int) -> float:
        self.sums += val
        self.length += 1
        self.window.append(val)
        if self.length > self.size:
            last = self.window.pop(0)
            # last = self.window.popleft()
            self.sums -= last
            self.length -= 1
        return self.sums/self.length


# Your MovingAverage object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MovingAverage(size)
# param_1 = obj.next(val)
```
